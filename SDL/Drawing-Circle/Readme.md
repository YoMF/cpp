## Problem:
How to fill/shade a circle only with rectangles?  
Here we use SDL library.

### Solution:
Draw a diagram and try it yourself to understand it.

we will fill the circle by finding the rectangle with the maximum area in each iteration.<br/>
How to find the maximum area. ?

We will be using ternary search. Since the derivatives i calculated resulted in unsolvable non-polynomial equations.
The width of the rectangle with the maximum area is a Unimodal function(I couldn't find a solid proof). But there has to be a single(atleast not atmost) rectangle  
with a maximum area.
